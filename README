scheme-reader, an extensible, fast, reader for Guile
====================================================

The idea: provide an extensible, yet fast, reader for Guile, GNU's
Scheme interpreter library.  Guile currently provides limited extensibility
of its reader, by means of `read-hash-extend', for instance, or `read-enable'
and the likes.  The point here is to be able to create a completely
customizable Scheme reader using basic building-blocks such as an
R5RS string reader, an sexp reader, etc., or even user-defined readers.

In order to achieve performance equivalent (or better?) to Guile's C
hand-coded reader, scheme-reader relies on GNU Lightning to compile readers
to native code.
